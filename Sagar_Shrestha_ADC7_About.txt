git clone

Here we'll examine the git clone command in depth. git clone is a Git command line utility which is used to target an existing repository and create a clone, or copy of the target repository. In this page we'll discuss extended configuration options and common use cases of git clone. Some points we'll cover here are:

Cloning a local or remote repository
Cloning a bare repository
Using shallow options to partially clone repositories
Git URL syntax and supported protocols
On the setting up a repository guide, we covered a basic use case of git clone. This page will explore more complex cloning and configuration scenarios.
 

 Push changes to GitHub
So far we have only modified our local copy of the repository. To add the changes to your git repo files on your computer to the version of your repository on GitHub, you need to push them GitHub.

You can push your changes to GitHub with:

git push
